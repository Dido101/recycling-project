    <h2>What Is Climate Change?</h2>
    <p>
      Climate change is the long-term warming of the planet and changes 
      in weather patterns, mainly caused by human activities that release 
      greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.
    </p>

    <h3>Main Causes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Burning coal, oil, and gas for energy and transport.</li>
      <li>Cutting down forests that absorb carbon dioxide.</li>
      <li>Farming practices that release gases like methane.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Possible Effects</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>More heatwaves and extreme weather.</li>
      <li>Rising sea levels and coastal flooding.</li>
      <li>Stress on wildlife and ecosystems.</li>
      <li>Impacts on food, water, and health for people.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What You Can Do</h3>
    <p>
      Small changes add up. You can:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use public transport, walk, or cycle when possible.</li>
      <li>Save energy at home by turning off lights and devices.</li>
